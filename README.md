## Web Studio Admin Platform 🗂️

1. The purpose of the platform: convenient and visual presentation of orders and work of studio staff<br>
2. The main process in the studio: the client has placed an order → then the admin on the platform creates a freelancer card (if not already created), creates an order and appoints a freelancer → then it is tracked<br>
3. To implement the platform, Admin LTE template based on Bootstrap was used<br>
4. The CRUD functions (create, read, update, delete) are based on data management in the application<br>
5. Mongodb was used to manage the database<br>
